# Bug Tracker Frontend

## Overview
This is the frontend part of the Bug Tracker application built using React. The application allows users to report bugs, view a list of reported bugs, and manage them effectively.

## Installation
To set up the frontend, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd bug-tracker/frontend
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application
To start the development server, run:
```
npm start
```
This will launch the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Testing
To run the tests for the frontend, use:
```
npm test
```
This command will execute the unit tests defined in the `src/tests` directory.

## Folder Structure
- `src/`: Contains all the source code for the frontend application.
  - `components/`: Contains reusable components like `BugList`.
  - `pages/`: Contains page components like `Home`.
  - `tests/`: Contains test files for components and pages.

## Debugging
For debugging, you can use the browser's developer tools. Additionally, ensure to check the console for any errors or warnings that may arise during development.
